Task: Implement Multi-Language Support with ng-translate
Description:
You are required to enhance an existing Angular application by integrating the ng-translate library to support multiple languages. The application should allow users to switch between different languages, and all the text content should be dynamically translated based on the user's language preference.
Requirements:
=============
[_] Setup ng-translate: Install the ng-translate library and configure it in
your Angular project. Set up the necessary dependencies and language files. 

[_] Language Selection: Implement a language selection feature that allows users to
switch between different languages. You can use a dropdown menu, buttons, or
any other UI element to facilitate language selection.

[_] Language Files: Create language files for at least two languages (e.g., English and Spanish).
These files should contain key-value pairs where the keys represent the
original English text and the values represent the translations in the
respective languages. 

[_] Translate Text Content: Replace all the static text
content in your application's components, templates, and services with the
translations from the language files. Use the appropriate ng-translate
directives or pipes to dynamically translate the text. 

[_] Language Persistence: Implement a mechanism to persist the user's language preference.
This can be achieved by storing the selected language in local storage or using
a cookie. Retrieve and apply the user's language preference when they revisit
the application. 

[_] Language Switching: Ensure that when the user switches the
language, all the text content in the application updates accordingly. This
should happen in real-time without requiring a page reload. 

[_] Dynamic Language Addition: Implement a feature that allows the addition of new
languages without modifying the existing codebase. This can be achieved by
providing a mechanism to load additional language files dynamically.

[_] Error Handling: Handle cases where translations are missing for certain keys or if
there are issues loading the language files. Display meaningful error messages
or fallback to a default language in such scenarios.
